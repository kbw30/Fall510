    "You comment your functions well, but the comment that describes what the function does should have been done using the \"\"\" so that it is supported by help(). Also, nice job on some of these implementations, very concise. You've also caught the important fact that your functions need to _return_ something, not just print it to the screen. This will help your functions work together and be predictable."
